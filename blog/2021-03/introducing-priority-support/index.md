At Octopus Deploy, how we support our customers has always been important to us. In the early days, the entire team, from our CEO down, answered support emails. As we grew, we added a dedicate team of support engineers who worked closely with our engineering teams to ensure we were giving our customer the best support we could.

In the last couple of years, we've added teams of support engineers in the UK and the US to cut down on the timezone lag that comes from working with a team that's based almost entirely in Australia.

We're really proud of how these teams are supporting our customers in their own timezones, and as we continue to grow, we're constantly looking for new ways to provide the kind of support our customers need.

## Priority support 

From February this year, we're offering Priority Support. Priority Support is an optional service for customers who need peace-of-mind guarantees around response times and availability for support tickets.

<!-- Priority support costs $800 per month paid annually at the same time as your license renews. -->Customers with Priority Support can expect a response within 1 hour to your first email, and then an average of 1 hour for all other emails until the support issue has been resolved. Priority Support is attached to your email domain, so as long as you email our support team from your registered email domain, your request will be flagged as a Priority Support request.

The program is still an early-access offering as we iron out some of the details, if you'd like to learn more, see the [Priority Support](https://octopus.com/priority-support) page. 

Priority support can be added to your account the next time you renew your license. If this is coming up soon for you and youâ€™re interested in priority support, reach out to our sales team at sales@octopus.com.
