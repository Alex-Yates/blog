![Introducing priority support](blogimage-introducing-priority-support.png)

At Octopus Deploy, how we support our customers has always been important to us. In the early days, the entire team, from our CEO down, answered support emails. As we grew, we added a dedicated team of support engineers who worked closely with our product engineering teams to ensure we were giving our customers the best support we could.

In the last couple of years, we've added teams of support engineers in the UK and the US to cut down on the time zone lag that comes from working with a team based almost entirely in Australia.

We're really proud of how these teams are supporting our customers in their own time zones, and as we continue to grow, we're constantly looking for new ways to provide the kind of support our customers need.

## Priority Support 

From February this year, we're offering Priority Support. Priority Support is an optional service for customers who need peace-of-mind guarantees around response times and availability for support tickets. Priority support is available 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Customers with Priority Support can expect: 
- A response within 1 hour to their first email.
- An average response time of 1 hour for all other emails until the support issue has been resolved. 

Priority Support is attached to your email domain, so as long as you email our support team from your registered email domain, your request will be flagged as a Priority Support request.

### How to access Priority Support

The program is still an early-access offering as we iron out some of the details. If you'd like to learn more, see the [Priority Support](https://octopus.com/priority-support) page. 

Priority Support can be added to your account the next time you renew your license. If this is coming up soon for you, and youâ€™re interested in priority support, reach out to our sales team at [sales@octopus.com](mailto:sales@octopus.com).
