At Octopus Deploy, we don't just want to build the world's best deployment tool; we want every interaction with us to be world-class. 

We knew we could do better with the Octopus Account, so we reimagined it, giving us a strong foundation for future features.

## How the Octopus Account evolved

The Octopus Account was pieced together over time. We built the first iteration when we released Octopus Cloud V1. 

We needed a place for account management tools, like billing. Then we needed Octopus ID, then self-service features like server license management. We continued adding features without considering the experience as a whole.

We want our customers to enjoy every touchpoint across Octopus, so with the Octopus Account well established, we’ve taken the time to redesign it thoughtfully.


## What's changed?

- It’s now called the Control Center, better identifying its purpose.
- The Control Center has more indicators to help with navigation, including:
   - Descriptive page titles, signposting of nested pages, and active states – to assist with orientation. 
   - We’ve exposed the organization you’re viewing on all pages – so you maintain context.
   - Details of your Cloud Instances are on separate pages – to allow for more robust user management features in the future.
- A Priority Support dashboard is visible to customers who have a [Priority Support] (https://octopus.com/blog/introducing-priority-support) agreement with us. 

We’ve shipped the new design across the Control Center, and all existing functions and features continue to work as they did previously.


## Conclusion

The Control Center is now a distinct space to manage your account, with intuitive wayfinding. These changes will pave the way for future features.

We hope the redesign makes it more enjoyable to use. Please let us know if you have suggestions for further improvements. 

Happy deployments!
