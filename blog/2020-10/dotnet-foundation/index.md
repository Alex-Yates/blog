Octopus Deploy is now a corporate sponsor for the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), the non-profit organization established to support the open-source ecosystem around the .NET platform. 

As an independent software vendor, we use a number of open source projects to build Octopus Deploy. We donate to some of these directly where we can - as sponsors of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2020/10/octopus-deploy), [JUnit](https://junit.org/), and a few others. 

More generally though, we also rely on a vibrant, sustainable open source ecosystem, particularly around .NET. Not all open source projects want direct sponsorship, but many projects can benefit from the .NET Foundation's efforts in championing .NET OSS adoption and contribution.  

As a corporate sponsor, we get a seat on the Advisory Council. These seats are rare, so rather than use it to advance our short-term interests, we thought hard about who would best serve the .NET community's interests in the long term. To that end, we've asked [Nicholas Blumhardt](https://nblumhardt.com/), the creator of Serilog and Autofac - two of the most popular open source .NET projects - to take our seat instead. I've had the pleasure of knowing Nick for the last decade and working with him occasionally, and I think Nick's presence on the advisory council will be a very positive one for the whole community. 

We think the .NET Foundation can have a bigger impact if it isn't wholly reliant on Microsoft for funding, and that with a growing variety of corporate sponsors, it will be able to achieve some important things and be a force for good. We're proud to chip in and give back to the community, and hopefully make open source a little more sustainable.
