I'm happy to announce that Octopus Deploy is now a corporate sponsor of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), the non-profit organization established to support the open-source ecosystem around the .NET platform. 

As an independent software vendor, we use a number of open source projects to build Octopus Deploy. We donate to some of these directly where we can - as sponsors of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2020/10/octopus-deploy), [JUnit](https://junit.org/), and a few others. We also make a lot of our own code open source - including our [communication stack](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Halibut), [deployment logic](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Calamari), [ORM](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Nevermore), and pretty soon our Tentacle deployment agent. Our team members also contribute to a variety of open source projects. Healthy open source is essential to our mission. 

More generally, we also rely on a vibrant, sustainable open source ecosystem around .NET. Not all open source projects want direct sponsorship, but many projects can benefit from the .NET Foundation's efforts in championing .NET OSS adoption and contribution. 

I think .NET open source is often underappreciated, both by enterprises and by Microsoft. It was open source projects that originally enabled modern practices like unit testing, build automation, inversion of control containers, and object/relational mapping to the .NET platform. If OSS hadn't filled those gaps, forward-thinking developers would have left for other platforms. OSS projects continue to fill those gaps today, and I hope the .NET Foundation will serve to make that more widely recognized. 

As a corporate sponsor, we get a seat on the Advisory Council. These seats are rare, so we thought hard about who would best serve the .NET community's interests in the long term. To that end, we've asked [Nicholas Blumhardt](https://nblumhardt.com/), the creator of Serilog and Autofac - two of the most popular open source .NET projects - to take our seat.  I've had the pleasure of knowing Nick for the last decade and working with him years ago, and I think Nick's presence on the advisory council will be a very positive influence. 

We think the .NET Foundation can have a bigger impact if it isn't wholly reliant on Microsoft for funding, and that with a growing variety of corporate sponsors, it will be able to achieve some important things and be a force for good. As a company that contributes to and benefits from open source, we're proud to chip in and give back to the community, and hopefully make open source a little more sustainable.
