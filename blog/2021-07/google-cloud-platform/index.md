In line with our public roadmap, we’re continuously rolling out cloud improvements, and we’re excited to introduce first-class support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

This fresh addition means that Octopus now offers native support to the three major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and now GCP), meeting the evolving needs of our customers, particularly those who have GCP K8s clusters and are running tentacles on GCP VMs. 

This native integration of Octopus with GCP will allow you to:
* Connect and authenticate with GCP via a dedicated account type.
* Use gcloud, the GCP command-line tool.
* Create and tear down GCP infrastructure with Terraform.
* Store and secure your Docker images within the Google Container Registry (GCR).
* Deploy, scale and manage containerized applications on GCP with Octopus and Kubernetes.
